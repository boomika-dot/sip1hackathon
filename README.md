# 🐥 Chick Counting using YOLO

This project was developed during **Socio spark Hackathon 2025** as part of a team effort.  
The objective was to detect and count chicks using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection.

## ✨ Features
- Detects and counts chicks in images or video frames.
- Uses YOLOv5 deep learning model.
- Python + OpenCV integration.

## 📌 My Role
- Contributed to testing model outputs and validating predictions.
- Gained exposure to GitHub collaboration and YOLO object detection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- YOLOv5  
- OpenCV  
- PyTorch  

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy with more training data.  
- Deploy model using Streamlit for real-time usage.
